*First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—*

  *Because I was not a Socialist.*

*Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—*

  *Because I was not a Trade Unionist.*

*Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—*

  *Because I was not a Jew.*

*Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.*
